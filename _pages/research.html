    <ul>
    <li>
        Led a research project to improve accessibility by converting lecture videos into book formats (PDFs), benefiting diverse learners and enhancing educational outcomes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implemented a Python-based pipeline to segment videos into chapters and extract representative images, producing well-structured book content.
    </li>
    <li>
        Developed AI-based solutions using open-source AI models (e.g., Ollama Vision, VGG-16) to address challenges such as slide transitions, animations, and annotations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transitioned beyond traditional methods like pixel-based analysis and SVM by integrating advanced AI tools to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency.
    </li>
    <li>
        Designed accessible outputs optimized for usability and readability, adhering to universal design principles.
    </li>
    <li>
        Explored CNN models to detect significant scene changes and incorporating OCR for textual extraction from slides.
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluated the quality and usability of generated book outputs through user feedback and iterative design improvements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Presented the project at the Undergraduate Researh Sympoisium (URS) at UIUC poster session under the title <i>"Enhancing Keyframe Extraction in Lecture Videos Using Optical Flow."</i>
