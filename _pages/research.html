    <ul>
    <li>
        Led a research project to improve accessibility by converting lecture videos into book formats (PDFs), benefiting diverse learners and enhancing educational outcomes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implemented a Python-based pipeline to segment videos into chapters and extract representative images, producing well-structured book content.
    </li>
    <li>
        Developed AI-based solutions using open-source AI models (e.g., Ollama Vision, VGG-16) to address challenges such as slide transitions, animations, and annotations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transitioned beyond traditional methods like pixel-based analysis and SVM by integrating advanced AI tools to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency.
    </li>
    <li>
        Designed accessible outputs optimized for usability and readability, adhering to universal design principles.
    </li>
    <li>
        Explored CNN models to detect significant scene changes and incorporating OCR for textual extraction from slides.
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluated the quality and usability of generated book outputs through user feedback and iterative design improvements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Presented the project at the Undergraduate Researh Sympoisium (URS) at UIUC poster session under the title <i>"Enhancing Keyframe Extraction in Lecture Videos Using Optical Flow."</i>

</p>

    <ul>
    <li>
        Conducted a computational social science research project to investigate how the rise of Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content has influenced user behavior and perceived answer quality on Stack Overflow from 2022 to 2024.
    </li>
    <li>
        Designed and implemented a scalable data pipeline using shell scripts and Python to extract, chunk, and preprocess 100,000+ Stack Overflow comments, ensuring balanced and representative samples from each year.
    </li>
    <li>
        Engineered time-offset features for comments by grouping data by thread and calculating their delay from the first response, enabling a fine-grained analysis of comment timing and engagement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Integrated GPT-detection scores through fuzzy matching techniques (using RapidFuzz), aligning LLM-generated comment predictions with high-scoring responses to study overlap between helpfulness and AI content.
    </li>
    <li>
        Visualized trends between comment timing, score, and predicted LLM-use to determine whether users value early, human-written answers more than delayed or LLM-generated responses.
    </li>
    <li>
        Presented research poster at Undergraduate Research Poster Session at UIUC.
    </li>
