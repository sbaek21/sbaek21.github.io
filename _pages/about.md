I am an incoming Master's student in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) for Fall 2025. My academic and professional work focuses on Machine Learning, NLP, human-computer interaction, and accessibility technologies. I've worked on research project with [Professor Lawrence Angrave](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/angrave) that improve educational accessibility by transforming lecture videos into book-like formats using Optical Flow, scene segmentation, OCR, and AI vision models.
Currently, I'm also conducting research in computational social science, examining the impact of LLM-generated content on online technical forums, analyzing engagement and discourse quality with large-scale data and AI detection methods.

Beyond research, I‚Äôve developed user-centric applications and AI-powered tools across a range of domains- including recommendation systems, public data visualization, energy modeling, and interactive media. I enjoy solving open-ended problems and designing technologies that make information more accessible and impactful.
